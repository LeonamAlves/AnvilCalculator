The calculator was made with the intention of being used to facilitate the use of the anvil in the TerraFirmaCraft Minecraft mod.

How to use:
First make the green arrow in the same position as the red one.
Fill in the selectors in the same sequence that appears in the game interface (left to right).
Press to calculate and in the game do the sequence that appears on the screen.
